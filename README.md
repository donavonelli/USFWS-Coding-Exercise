# USFWS-Coding-Exercise
Coding Exercise for Mindbank

# Hello! Welcome to my Coding Exercise 
I hope you enjoy your visit here and I am open to answering any and all questions you may have

# Project breakdown
You can find the 3 java classes i've created in app/src/main/java/com/adonyastudios/codingchallenge

*Apologies for this prject structure. This was coded in the Android Studio IDE and the resulting files was the result of starting a new project*
#### Vertex class
Represents a Vertex for the DAG. Comes equipped with a name field, layer field and To/From connection containers to other Vertices
#### DAG class
Represents a Directed Acyclic Graph. Main use is connecting Vertices and calculating the longest path for a given Vertex
#### Main class
Main use is to set up sample data and run the longest path calculation

# Thought Process
While the majority of my thought process is displayed in the code through (System.out.println)s I did have a piece of scrap paper that shows some preliminary thoughts as well as visualizing the two DAGs i ultimately ended up coding
